= The Use Case

Acme Inc. is facing issues within their CI/CD system, and they're asking you to build a Gen AI based solution for them.

== The Challenge

Acme Inc. has a critical CI/CD pipeline that frequently fails due to various issues such as:

* Build failures due to dependency conflicts
* Deployment errors caused by configuration mismatches
* Resource constraints leading to timeouts
* Integration test failures requiring manual investigation

The current process requires developers to:

* Manually investigate error logs
* Search through documentation for solutions
* Create GitHub issues for tracking problems
* Manually restart failed pipelines
* Coordinate with team members for resolution

This manual intervention is:

* Time-consuming and delays releases
* Error-prone due to human oversight
* Not scalable as the team grows
* Lacking consistent documentation of solutions

== The Solution: AI-Powered CI/CD Agent

We will build an intelligent agent that can:

* Detect and analyze CI/CD failures
* Interact with OpenShift to query cluster resources and pod status
* Search for relevant solutions using web search and documentation
* Provide actionable recommendations to developers
* Create GitHub issue in the specified repository for tracking
